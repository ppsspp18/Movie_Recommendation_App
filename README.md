# Movie Recommendation System App

This project is a **Movie Recommendation System** built using **Python** for backend processing and **Flutter (Dart)** for the frontend mobile application. It provides personalized movie recommendations and an interactive app interface for users to manage their favorite and watchlist movies.

---

## Features

### Backend (Python)
- Built a **movie recommendation system** using:
  - **TF-IDF Vectorization** for text-based feature extraction.
  - **Cosine Similarity** for similarity computation between movies.
- Generates:
  - **Top 10 similar movie recommendations** for each movie.
  - **Top 10 similar movie recommendations by language** for each movie.
- Output is stored in a structured **JSON file**, containing:
  - Movie title
  - Movie overview
  - Movie genre
  - Movie language
  - Top 10 recommendations
  - Top 10 recommendations by language

### Frontend (Flutter)
- Uses the JSON output from the Python backend.
- Provides the following features:
  -  **Search** movies by **title** or **genre**
  -  **Liked Movies** list
  -  **Watch Later** list
  -  View content based recommendations per movie

##  Getting Started

### Backend (Python)
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
   ```
2. Run the recommendation script:
   ```bash
   movies_recommendation_system.ipynb
   ```
   This creates `movies.json` with recommendations.

### Frontend (Flutter)
1. Navigate to the `frontend/` directory.
2. Get dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Python** (Pandas, scikit-learn)
- **Flutter** (Dart)
- **JSON** for data transfer between backend and frontend

---

## 📦 Future Improvements

- Add real-time API instead of static JSON
- Implement user authentication and personalized profiles
- Store liked/watchlist movies persistently (using Firebase or local DB)
